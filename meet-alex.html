            First thing you need to know about me is that I have way too many hobbies and enjoy all of them. However, the most important thing for me is my family. Currently, that is Marie and our puppies, Apollo and Athena, but we would love to add another member. My hobbies range from playing sports, reading books, playing video games, playing board games and other things. I am active with a local Boy Scout Troop and I go camping with them at least once a month. I love to try new things to add to my hobby list.
            </p>
            <p>
              My favorite sports are basketball and soccer. When I was in high school I played on my high school team for both sports. I was never a star player, but I practiced hard and just loved the exercise. Recently, I have been playing basketball every week with a group at our church. It has been very fun to build that bond with those around me.
            </p>
            <p>
            I love to read and my favorite author is Brandon Sanderson. I love the cosmere that he is creating. One of my favorite books from him is “Elantris”. I have spent tons of time reading and love to tell stories.
            </p>
            <p>
              Video and board games are some of my other hobbies because I love adventures. I love to experience stories through these mediums as well as books. I love how board games bring people together to talk and have a good time.
            </p>
            <p>
              Other hobbies that I have enjoyed recently have been woodworking. I made a set of blocks for four of my nephews for Christmas and plan to continue working with my hands to do more fun projects.
            </p>
            <p>
              For work, I am a programmer. I love my job. I enjoy solving puzzles and with programming it's always a new puzzle. My employers really appreciate the work I do. I know that I found what I love to do for a job. The company I work for is very stable and is growing.
            </p>
            <p>
              My life goal has always been to have a family and kids and I always want to provide for them. I want to take them to Disney World and other fun trips.
            </p>

          <p class="pb-0 mb-0">
          I love that Alex is always thinking about me and how to make my day better. I love that Alex can talk to anyone and has the ability to make everyone feel like they are the most important person in the world. He is such a good listener and will do anything he can for anyone. He is always looking for opportunities to serve in our community. He is an incredibly hard worker and I admire his dedication to his career, but most of all to me and our family. I have watched him love and care for our niece and nephews and our friends children. The kids love him and I can see his love for them. I am so excited to be his partner in raising our children. He is my very best friend, and I love him more every day!

              My family is my parents and three sisters. I am the second oldest and obviously the only son. We are very close and talk regularly. My older sister has four kids three boys and 1 girl. They live in Texas as well, so we always look forward to the weekends we get to go spend with them. Our niece and nephews bring a lot of joy to our lives. My two younger sisters just recently gave birth to baby boys, but they live in Utah. We usually try to meet up at least once or twice a year and hang out for a week or two.
            </p>
            <p>
              My dad is my hero and such a great role model. I learned so many great lessons from my dad and hope I can be that role model too. Growing up my mom’s family would have reunions once a year and we would get together for a week and go to the beach or camping or something fun. We always look forward to the big Cowley reunions. We also love to hang out with my dad’s family. We love to visit them and watch movies and play games. My family and extended family are very close. This is a very important aspect of life that I always want in my family.
